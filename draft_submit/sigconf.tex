\begin{abstract}
The convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the deep learning models, has seen much success in a variety of computer vision tasks. However, designing CNN architectures still requires expert knowledge and \new{a lot of trial and error.} In this paper, we attempt to automatically construct \new{CNN} architectures for an image classification task based on Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). In our method, we adopt \new{highly functional} modules\new{,} such as convolutional blocks and tensor concatenation\new{,} as the node functions in CGP. The CNN structure and connectivity represented by the CGP encoding method are optimized to maximize the validation accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed \new{a} CNN architecture for the image classification task with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can \new{be used to} automatically find the competitive CNN architecture compared with state-of-the-art models.
%Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network(CNN) have seen much success in a variety of machine learning tasks.
%However, designing CNN architectures still requires expert experience and many iterations.
%In this paper, we propose a genetic programming based approach that automatically designs CNN architectures.
%Our method represents the CNN architecture as a feedforward network structure that is similar to cartesian genetic programming, and optimizes the structure and connectivity of the network to maximize the accuracy on a learning set.
%On the image classification task with the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method achieves a test error rate of $8.17$, which is competitive with state-of-the-art-methods.
